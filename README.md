# HandShakeAuth
Hand Shake Authentication (HSAuth) in GO-Lang.
Advanced authentication system using two pairs of keys. The server and the user only exchange public keys and calculate the 'shared secret'. If they are the same, it means that the authentication process was successful. The security phenomenon of this method is that we do not store the password on the server.
